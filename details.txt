Your main task will be to develop a weather application that retrieves data from a weather API(OpenWeatherMap can be used)
and presents current weather information for a specified location. Users should be able to easily search for cities, view 
current temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant details, with the flexibility to add and monitor multiple cities. 
 
Requirements: 
React Project Setup: Initialize a React project and create essential components for the weather application.
OpenWeatherMap Apis: you can use openWeatherMap Apis for receiving Data.
Form Component: Implement a form component enabling users to input city names. Manage input field state and handle weather data fetched from the API. 
Display Weather Information: Show current temperature, weather conditions, and additional relevant data retrieved from the API. 
City Management: Enable users to add multiple cities to their weather dashboard for convenient weather tracking. 
Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling for cases such as invalid city names or failed API requests, displaying appropriate error messages.  
Responsiveness: Make the application responsive to varying screen sizes and devices for optimal user experience. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
Code Quality: Assess code for cleanliness, readability, and organization.
Error Handling: Evaluate the effectiveness of error handling and input validation mechanisms. 
Testing: Review comprehensive test coverage across various scenarios. 
Documentation: Ensure clear and thorough documentation for ease of understanding and maintenance.  
Submission Guidelines:
